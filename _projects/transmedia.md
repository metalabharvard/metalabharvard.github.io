metaLAB is partnering with the Mahindra Humanities Center to sponsor the [Transmedia Arts Seminar](https://mahindrahumanities.fas.harvard.edu/transmedia-arts), chaired by [Magda Romanska](https://mahindrahumanities.fas.harvard.edu/people/magda-romanska) and [Hana Worthen](https://mahindrahumanities.fas.harvard.edu/people/hana-worthen). The seminar considers the intersection of contemporary art/theatre and new media technologies, taking up immersive, multisite, and networked modes of transmedia storytelling, performances instrumentalizing a range of live and digital platforms and formats, including social media, augmented and virtual reality, haptic and digital technology, visual and audio mapping, human/AI interaction, algorithms, and bodily and sensory enhancements.

For the 2020-21 academic year, all seminar meetings will take place as webinars on Zoom; for all details, see the schedule and registration links below.
