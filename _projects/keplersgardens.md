**ONLINE<br />
Friday, September 11<br />
12-2pm EDT** 

Click through for [**LIVESTREAM EVENT REGISTRATION**](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_1OqrxWZWT6WhPXxFD8ScTQ).

In partnership with the Austrian Academy of Sciences, metaLAB is bringing [Curatorial A(i)gents](https://metalabharvard.github.io/projects/curatorial-aigents/) to the [Ars Electronica 2020 festival](https://ars.electronica.art/keplersgardens/en/), happening 9â€“13 September in Linz, Austria and, virtually, around the world. 

The theme for this year's festival, "Kepler's Gardens," highlights the tenuous connections binding the world together in this critical time, with attention to two binaries in particular: AUTONOMY vs. DEMOCRACY and TECHNOLOGY vs. ECOLOGY. The projects in Curatorial A(i)gents cut across these binaries with wit and great pertinence, and we're excited to bring them to Ars Electronica's worldwide audience.


In addition to sharing our projects in the festival's virtual exhibition, on Friday, September 11, metaLAB will host an online gathering with Curatorial A(i)gents artists, contributors to the program's accompanying publication, and members of the wider community.
