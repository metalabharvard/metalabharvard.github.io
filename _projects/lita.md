Wifi-proof booths; study carrels for napping; digital campfires for charging devices convivially—in the *Library Test Kitchen* seminar at the Graduate School of Design, metaLAB (at) Harvard has been exploring participatory innovation for libraries through fun, creative, improvisatory projects. And what's a test kitchen without recipes? In this session, members of metaLAB will be on hand to demo their new platform for sharing such "recipes" for playful innovation in libraries—and to invite participants to contribute recipes of their own.

From [LITA](https://forum.lita.org/about/):<br />
*The LITA Forum is the annual gathering of about 300 technology-minded information professionals. It is the conference where technology meets the practicality of daily information operations in archives, libraries, and other information services. The Forum is an ideal place to interact with fellow library technologists. Attendees are working at the cutting edge of library technology and are interested in making connections with technically-inclined colleagues and learn about new directions and projects in libraries.*
