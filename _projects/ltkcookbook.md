Started at Harvard in 2011, the Library Test Kitchen is a seminar and community bringing together librarians, students, and designers to explore innovative new programs, services, and spatial strategies for libraries. Participants created wifi-proof booths, study carrels for napping, and digital campfires for charging devices convivially. Over its life, the seminar created a pop-up library lab in a retail storefront space in Harvard Square, visited SXSW, and moved from Harvard to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at Simmons College. 

Now, it's forking again, into a cookbook in parts: first, this platform for sharing "recipes" for playful, participatory innovation in libraries; and second, a book, to be published by MIT Press. <a href="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org">And you can contribute!</a> Feel free to browse the recipes collected hereâ€”and to use them, share them, adapt them, and share back, by contributing recipes of your own!
