[Sensate](http://sensatejournal.com/) is an online, media-based journal for the creation, presentation, and scholarly critique of innovative creative projects in the arts, humanities, sciences, and media. Driven by the conviction that the making of creative projects is an inherent part of academic or scholarly work, we aim to expand conversations and collaborative communities among scholars, film/videomakers, sound artists, and others. Initiated within Harvardâ€™s [Sensory Ethnography Lab](http://sel.fas.harvard.edu/) and produced jointly with metaLAB (at) Harvard, Sensate is a collaborative and interdisciplinary initiative involving graduate students and faculty as well as independent artists and scholars from various universities, centers and departments, with the intent to integrate new modes of media-based scholarship and critical media practice into the cognitive life of the academy and beyond.
