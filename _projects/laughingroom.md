**The Laughing Room<br />
November 16–18, 2018**

An interactive multimedia installation by [Jonny Sun](https://twitter.com/jonnysun), in collaboration with [Hannah Davis](https://twitter.com/ahandvanish) and Christopher Sun. Research assistant: [Nikhil Dharmaraj](https://twitter.com/nikdharmaraj).

Created at metaLAB(at)Harvard and Prof. Stephanie Frampton’s [ARTificial Intelligence group at MIT](https://arts.mit.edu/artists/stephanie-framptons-artificial-intelligence/#about-the-project).

Funded by metaLAB(at)Harvard, the MIT De Florez Fund for Humor, the Council of the Arts at MIT, and the MIT Center For Art, Science & Technology. Supported by MIT FX and High Output, Inc. Sponsored by the Cambridge Public Library and MIT Libraries. 

#TheLaughingRoom

**1/THE LAUGHING ROOM** is an interactive art installation in which participants enter an artificially intelligent room, designed to resemble a sitcom set, that plays a laugh track whenever the participants say something that the room’s algorithm deems to be worth laughing with.

The Laughing Room is connected to a machine learning algorithm trained on large dataset of audio transcripts of stand-up comedians. The algorithm will determine the patterns that precede laughter, and then react accordingly to the voices of the live participants. 

Participants will spend time in the room learning how to “perform” to the room, and reacting to the emotional response that the room provides. The piece will also be recorded and live-streamed via video camera and audio to THE CONTROL ROOM, hosted in parallel at the MIT Libraries.

The project addresses the increasing social and cultural roles of responsive technologies in public and private spaces, users’ agency within and their dependence on these emerging emotional-social technologies, and the implicit questions of privacy involved in these systems. It also aims to address the ubiquity of emotionally manipulative online algorithms and platforms creating a translation of such an algorithm into a real world space.


**2/THE CONTROL ROOM** is the companion installation to The Laughing Room. It is an interactive installation that features several screens showing different views of The Laughing Room, including real-time streaming video and audio of the exhibit itself, as well as live-streams from social media feeds such as Periscope/Twitter, Instagram Live, and Facebook Live.

The Control Room’s live-stream videos will be available for public online viewing when The Laughing Room is open, and are accessible at the following links:  [Periscope](https://www.pscp.tv/thelaughingroom) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thelaughingroom/) / [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcHx9-QlKDkXJ3agEUa_woA) / [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/The-Laughing-Room-255168968503873/) / [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thelaughingroom)

**TEAM:**

**Jonny Sun** is the author and illustrator of *everyone’s a aliebn when ur a aliebn too* (Harper Perennial, 2017), the New York Times best-selling illustrator of *Gmorning, Gnight!* by Lin-Manuel Miranda (Random House, 2018), and three forthcoming books. He is currently a writer for the Netflix Original Series *BoJack Horseman*. Named one of Time’s 25 Most Influential People on the Internet of 2017, Sun is currently a doctoral candidate at MIT, an affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, and a creative researcher at the metaLAB at Harvard, where he studies social media, virtual place, and online identity. As a playwright, his work has been performed at the Yale School of Drama, Factory Theater in Toronto, and Hart House Theater. As an artist and illustrator, his work has been exhibited at MIT, the Yale School of Architecture, New Haven ArtSpace, and the University of Toronto. He previously studied as an architect (M.Arch., Yale) and engineer (B.A.Sc., University of Toronto). He is the creator of @tinycarebot and the co-creator of the MIT Humor Series. His comedic work has appeared on NPR and in Time, BuzzFeed, GQ, and McSweeney’s, and he has been profiled in The New York Times Magazine. His work can be found at [jonathan-sun.com](http://www.jonathan-sun.com/) and [@jonnysun](https://twitter.com/jonnysun) on Twitter.

**Hannah Davis** is a programmer and generative musician. Her work falls along the lines of music generation, data sonification, artificial intelligence, and sentiment analysis. For a few years now she has been working on an algorithm called TransProse, which identifies emotions in a piece of text and translates it into a musical piece with a similar emotional tone. A human-computer collaboration, where she analyzed the sentiment of articles talking about technology over time, was recently performed by an orchestra at The Louvre. Hannah is currently working on creating unique datasets for art and machine learning, and is also working on a project to generatively score films. Through her work on emotions in AI, she’s become particularly interested in the idea of "subjective data" and has recently started further research into this area. She is a 2017 AI Grant recipient. Her work can be found at [www.hannahishere.com](http://www.hannahishere.com/) and [www.musicfromtext.com](http://www.musicfromtext.com/).

**Christopher Sun**

**Nikhil Dharmaraj** is a senior at The Harker School in sunny San Jose, California. As a student, he is fascinated by the academic space lying at the intersection of technology and the humanities. An avid software developer, Nikhil has pursued computer science through post-AP coursework, iOS hackathons, extra-curricular courses, the USA Computing Olympiad, and summer internships at MIT and Carnegie Mellon. However, as a passionate proponent of interdisciplinary study, Nikhil has delved deeply into the humanities as well. For the past six years, he has been nationally ranked in Original Oratory (a competitive speech event within NSDA) and energetically leads his speech team as Captain. And, as a member of CAJCL (California Junior Classical League), he has excelled in the classics, serving as vice president of his school’s chapter, and is currently researching the Roman roots of evolutionary theory under the Mitra Family Grant in the Humanities. Outside of school, Nikhil is a co-founder of 501 Ventures and inCSpire, two non-profit organizations dedicated to educational equity in the Bay Area. In his free time, Nikhil enjoys playing the tenor saxophone, learning Dhol (a folk Indian percussion instrument), baking, skiing, and playing with his dog.

**Sarah Newman** is a Creative Researcher at metaLAB at Harvard, and a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. As a researcher expressing ideas through installation art, her work engages with technology's role in culture. Newman holds a BA in Philosophy from Washington University in St. Louis and an MFA in Imaging Arts from the Rochester Institute of Technology. She has exhibited work in New York, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Berlin, and Rome, and has held artist residencies in Germany and Sweden. Newman is a 2017 AI Grant Fellow, a member of the 2018 Assembly Cohort, and leads metaLAB's ongoing initiative that explores the intersections of AI and human experience. Her current work explores social and philosophical dimensions of artificial intelligence, using interactive art as a means of critique and public engagement.

**Matthew Battles** is associate director of metaLAB at Harvard, where he develops design interventions, media provocations, and technology projects in collaboration with a team of architects, web designers, scholars and artists. Matthew has written about the cultural dimensions of science and technology for such venues as The American Scholar, The Atlantic, The Boston Globe, Harper’s Magazine, and The New York Times. His book Library: an Unquiet History (W. W. Norton) is available in eight languages worldwide and has been in print since 2003, and he is coauthor, with Jeffrey Schnapp, of The Library Beyond the Book (Harvard 2014).
