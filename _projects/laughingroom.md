**1/THE LAUGHING ROOM** is an interactive art installation in which participants enter an artificially intelligent room, designed to resemble a sitcom set, that plays a laugh track whenever the participants say something that the room’s algorithm deems to be worth laughing with.

The Laughing Room is connected to a machine learning algorithm trained on large dataset of audio transcripts of stand-up comedians. The algorithm will determine the patterns that precede laughter, and then react accordingly to the voices of the live participants. 

Participants will spend time in the room learning how to “perform” to the room, and reacting to the emotional response that the room provides. The piece will also be recorded and live-streamed via video camera and audio to THE CONTROL ROOM, hosted in parallel at the MIT Libraries.

The project addresses the increasing social and cultural roles of responsive technologies in public and private spaces, users’ agency within and their dependence on these emerging emotional-social technologies, and the implicit questions of privacy involved in these systems. It also aims to address the ubiquity of emotionally manipulative online algorithms and platforms creating a translation of such an algorithm into a real world space.


**2/THE CONTROL ROOM** is the companion installation to The Laughing Room. It is an interactive installation that features several screens showing different views of The Laughing Room, including real-time streaming video and audio of the exhibit itself, as well as live-streams from social media feeds such as Periscope/Twitter, Instagram Live, and Facebook Live.

The Control Room’s live-stream videos will be available for public online viewing when The Laughing Room is open, and are accessible at the following links:  [Periscope](https://www.pscp.tv/thelaughingroom) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thelaughingroom/) / [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcHx9-QlKDkXJ3agEUa_woA) / [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/The-Laughing-Room-255168968503873/) / [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thelaughingroom)

**Jonny Sun** is the author and illustrator of *everyone’s a aliebn when ur a aliebn too* (Harper Perennial, 2017), the New York Times best-selling illustrator of *Gmorning, Gnight!* by Lin-Manuel Miranda (Random House, 2018), and three forthcoming books. He is currently a writer for the Netflix Original Series *BoJack Horseman*. Named one of Time’s 25 Most Influential People on the Internet of 2017, Sun is currently a doctoral candidate at MIT, an affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, and a creative researcher at the metaLAB at Harvard, where he studies social media, virtual place, and online identity. As a playwright, his work has been performed at the Yale School of Drama, Factory Theater in Toronto, and Hart House Theater. As an artist and illustrator, his work has been exhibited at MIT, the Yale School of Architecture, New Haven ArtSpace, and the University of Toronto. He previously studied as an architect (M.Arch., Yale) and engineer (B.A.Sc., University of Toronto). He is the creator of @tinycarebot and the co-creator of the MIT Humor Series. His comedic work has appeared on NPR and in Time, BuzzFeed, GQ, and McSweeney’s, and he has been profiled in The New York Times Magazine. His work can be found at [jonathan-sun.com](http://www.jonathan-sun.com/) and [@jonnysun](https://twitter.com/jonnysun) on Twitter.

**Hannah Davis** is a programmer and generative musician. Her work falls along the lines of music generation, data sonification, artificial intelligence, and sentiment analysis. For a few years now she has been working on an algorithm called TransProse, which identifies emotions in a piece of text and translates it into a musical piece with a similar emotional tone. A human-computer collaboration, where she analyzed the sentiment of articles talking about technology over time, was recently performed by an orchestra at The Louvre. Hannah is currently working on creating unique datasets for art and machine learning, and is also working on a project to generatively score films. Through her work on emotions in AI, she’s become particularly interested in the idea of "subjective data" and has recently started further research into this area. She is a 2017 AI Grant recipient. Her work can be found at [www.hannahishere.com](http://www.hannahishere.com/) and [www.musicfromtext.com](http://www.musicfromtext.com/).

**Christopher Sun** is a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Toronto studying Industrial Engineering. His work combines operations research, machine learning, and public health to develop innovative artificial intelligence frameworks to improve prehopsital interventions to treat out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Christopher's work has been recognized by numerous institutions and is a recipient of a Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship (2017), as well as an American Heart Association Young Investigator Award (2016). His research on the optimization of automated external defibrillator placements has appeared on *Global News TV*, *Huffington Post*, *Globe and Mail*, and *CBC*.
