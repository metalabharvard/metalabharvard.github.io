metaLAB will make our debut appearance at the international Mozilla Festival, MozFest, in London this weekend, with [Moral Labyrinth](../morallabyrinth), a walking installation created by Sarah Newman that contends with the Value Alignment Problem in artificial intelligence. This is part of metaLAB's ongoing exploration of the intersection of Art + AI, particularly focused on using interactive art to reflect on social and ethical problems that AI developments make relevant.

From [MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/about):<br />

*MozFest began as a small gathering in 2010 — a few hundred fiery thinkers dreaming and planning in Barcelona, Spain. Our goal was to connect people building a healthy Internet.
A healthy Internet is one that’s accessible to all; decentralized; bursting with vibrant, creative communities, trustworthy content, and groundbreaking ideas. It’s an Internet where users control their data, and privacy and intellectual freedom thrive. An Internet not of passive consumers, but of active creators, building and shaping online tools and spaces.*

*Today, the Internet is deeply entwined in our everyday lives, and MozFest, too, has grown. In 2017, we hosted 2,500 activists, coders, journalists and educators from 50 countries. The Festival unfolds in London, across seven days and two venues. It’s now co-designed with over 40 community volunteers. But our goal — to make our Internet, and our world, better — remains the same.*

*This year, ideas from Mozilla’s first full-length [Internet Health Report](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/) — a deep look at how the Internet and human life intersect — are at the heart of the festival. At MozFest 2018, we’ll strategize our next moves in global campaigns for net neutrality, data privacy, and online freedom. We’ll advance thinking on topics like [ethical AI](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/intelligent-machines-arent-always-right/) and [common-sense tech policy](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/germanys-hate-speech-law-makes-global-waves/). We’ll collaborate on code, on art and practical ideas, creating seeds for the next great open-source products."* <br />
