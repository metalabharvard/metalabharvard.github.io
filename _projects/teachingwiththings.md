Teaching With Things advanced a technologically-enabled, media-rich, and intellectually lively approach to object-oriented instruction in the liberal arts. Leveraging Harvardâ€™s unique archival, library, and museum collections, and established and emergent technology for digital imaging, 3D modeling, and multimedia annotation and presentation, and recognizing that collections- based teaching, research, and training remain, at best, of secondary importance within most fields of the humanities and social sciences, the project created a flexible, scalable, hybrid practice of digital curation to bear in the classroom. It associated extant resources of digital text, sound, and still and moving image with experimental 3D scanning and prototyping to create rich multimedia contexts, through which students in a series of specially-designed experimental courses engaged collections objects in their fullest material dimensions.
