In addition to running courses, metaLAB also works with graduate students through collaboration or to serve in an advisory capacity. Graduate students have collaborated on the following current and past metaLAB projects: Curricle, Curarium, Japan Disaster Archive, Feral Trees, Silence is a Fabrication, as well as studied with metaLAB in the Humanities Studio courses, Beautiful Data workshops, and Wintersession courses.  Members of metaLAB also sit on review committees, meet with students one-on-one, and give guest lectures in courses. In addition to making contributions to metaLAB projects, graduate students are welcome to bring their in-progress media, design, and data-intensive projects to the group for feedback as well. For more information about meeting or collaborating, email us.
