**Color Rx**
<br />Maia Leandra
<br />Interactive installation with color prescriptions
<br />2017

Thursday, August 11, 10am-4pm
<br />Gallery talk 3pm

Harvard Art Museums
<br />Lightbox Gallery

Color is ephemeral and complex. An installation in the Lightbox Gallery at Harvard Art Museums, <em>Color Rx</em> contended with the individuality of perception, while maintaining that the experiences in which perceptions are grounded can be traced back to, and tethered together by, a common, colorful trend. Drawing inspiration from from Harvard Art Museums’ Forbes Pigment Collection, scholarly texts, and the artist’s knowledge and intuition, the piece explored lines between truth and belief, color and illusion. And yet its prescriptions, unconventional and mysterious though they may be, made connections and produced impacts in the world, for gallery visitors and others.

<em>Color Rx</em> used a computer algorithm to diagnose a viewer’s inputs and “prescribe a color” in response. The piece was grounded in questions about trust in, or benefit from, “smart” systems, often in contexts where the algorithms are opaque—even when the output is very concrete. What does it mean for machines or systems to drive our behavior? Can we adequately assess the benefits and risks?
