Dictionnaire Apollinaire is a new research collaboration, based at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BnF), between L’Observatoire de La vie Littéraire (OBVIL) and metaLAB at the Université Paris-Sorbonne. OBVIL and metaLAB are working together on the design and construction of a nomadic interactive installation and database, which will reveal the thousands of diverse media objects (manuscripts, texts, audio, videos, photographs, and newspapers) of the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire (1880-1918). At present, many of these resources currently lie dormant, dispersed in several Parisian libraries and archives, such as the BnF, the Bibliothèque Historique de la Ville de Paris, and the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet. Simultaneously, the project is conceived as a research toolbox that will enable students, scholars, and aficionados to explore Apollinaire’s work through the lens of new educational and research digital interfaces.
