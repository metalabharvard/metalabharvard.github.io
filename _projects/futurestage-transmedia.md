With new expectations for media, culture, and presence in a hyperconnected world, the civic stakes of the performing arts are shifting. futureStage is a global research collaborative dedicated to investigating new scenarios for the performing arts in society. Newly released, the futureStage Manifesto offers a vision of performance as a human right, intimately entangled with all the stages on which contemporary life is performed, and offering global society new skills, sensibilities, and points of view.

In this talk, members of the futureStage collaborative will present the manifesto, explore precedents and opportunities for innovation in connected theatre, and imagine where we go next.

Panelists:

Professor Jeffrey Schnapp, Faculty Director, metaLAB (at) Harvard; and co-lead, futureStage Collaborative.

Professor Magda Romanska, Associate Professor of Theatre Studies and Dramaturgy, Emerson College; Research Affiliate, metaLAB at Harvard; Chair, Transmedia Arts Seminar at Mahindra Humanities Center; and futureStage member/collaborator.
