Vassar College

From [Vassar CAAD](http://creativearts.vassar.edu/news/announcements/2017-2018/170928-blueprint-counter-education.html):

Blueprint for Counter Education was one of the defining (but neglected) works of radical pedagogy of the Vietnam War era.  Originally published in 1970, the book was accompanied by large posters that could serve as a portable learning environment for a new process-based model of education. In 2016 Blueprint was reissued in facsimile with an added booklet of essays and interviews  about the original publication by Harvard’s Jeffrey T. Schnapp '75 and designer Adam Michaels, published by Inventory Press.

Schnapp and Michaels will deliver a lecture about the expanded version of the book on Thursday, September 28, 5:30pm, in Taylor Hall, room 203, and it is free and open to the public.

Schnapp, is the founder/faculty director of metaLAB (at) Harvard and faculty co-director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. At Harvard, he holds the Carl A. Pescosolido Chair in Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Michaels is the founder and principle of the design firm Project Projects and the New York and Los Angeles-based  arts publishing firm Inventory Press.

This event is sponsored by the Agnes Rindge Claflin Fund, Department of Art, Department of Media Studies, Creative Arts Across Disciplines, Program for Teaching Development at Vassar College, Tatlock Chair of Multdisciplinary Studies, the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, and the Vassar College Libraries.
