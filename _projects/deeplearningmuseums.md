Deep Learning in the Museum seeks to explore how machine learning can be employed to develop new ways of working with museum collections in the interconnecting domains of cultural-historical scholarship and curatorial practice. It aims to investigate the generative powers and limits of emerging artificial- intelligence technologies while, in the process, looking into critical issues at the intersection between technology and culture. In so doing, the project seeks to experiment with new historio-graphical and critical practices and to engage a robust dialogue in theory and practice within the disciplines of curatorship, history, art history, and visual culture studies.
