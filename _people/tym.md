Tym Yee is a visual artist and PhD candidate at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. His doctoral research investigates the emergence of internal innovation cultures in corporate organisations, questioning what becomes of the future of work when constant technological disruption is expected of every employee across the knowledge economy. Methodologically, he draws on new media theory, ethnography, and creative practice to bring ubiquitous white-collar work settings into contact with speculative art making. Yee participated in the Berkman Klein Centerâ€™s summer internship program in 2017, and in 2020 was awarded a Fulbright Postgraduate (Research) Scholarship to work with metaLAB (at) Harvard to further develop his scholarly methodology and his conceptual practise. Beyond academia, Tym regularly exhibits his paintings with a variety of art galleries in Sydney, including Michael Reid Northern Beaches and Uralla Gallery.
