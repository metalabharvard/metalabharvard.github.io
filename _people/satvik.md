As a student of arts and technology, Satvik is eager to bring the two disciplines closer through real world applications. When not thinking about the intersection of the two, he likes tinkering with neural networks, discovering new artists, and watching everything sports. His recent works have focused on the interpretation of art through the eyes of machines. 

He also keeps an eye out on the latest developments in Deep Learning and uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to explore his creative thoughts. As one of his favorite creative artists (Anna Ridler) said about generative art "It's the difference between the noun and the verb 'draw': computers can make drawings, but they canâ€™t draw." Apart from these, he loves to share his insights and experiences through teaching and workshops.
