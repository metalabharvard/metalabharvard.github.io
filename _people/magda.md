She has taught 30 different courses on theatre, performance and transmedia, including at Harvard University, Yale School of Drama, Cornell University, and Emerson College; and worked on over 30 theatre and opera productions. 

At metaLAB, she researches her new book project on transmediality of multiplatform, multisite, multigenre narratives, which in addition to deploying familiar plot-driven structural devices (inciting incident, climax, denouement), often incorporate multiple access points, serendipity, immersion, worldbuilding, role play, seriality, and time/space co-presence. With new technologies and new genres, transmedial dramaturgy also developed new questions: how are we to analyze, think critically, and develop narratives that use multiple structural and architectural frameworks?
