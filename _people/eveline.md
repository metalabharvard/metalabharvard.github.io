Eveline Wandl-Vogt is experimentalist, foundress and senior director of one of the two first Ars Electronica Research Institutes, namely [knowledge for humanity](https://ars.electronica.art/futurelab/initiative/ars-electronica-research-institute-for-knowledge-for-humanity/) (k4h+) at [Ars Electronica](https://ars.electronica.art/news/). The research institute is an antidisciplinary approach to apply human centered design and open innovation methods and practices to contribute to invent the future.

She is foundress and coordinator of the transdisciplinary movement exploration space at the [Austrian Academy of Sciences](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/), [Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/acdh-home/). exploration space is an open space for innovation and experimentation for the networked humanities with the aim of stimulating, designing, enabling and scientifically analyzing new forms of knowledge production at the interface of science, technology and society. 

Both endeavours are best practice examples for open innovation of the Austrian government (k4h+, [exploration space](http://openinnovation.gv.at/portfolio/oeaw-exploration-space/)); both are vivid collaboration frameworks between artists, business companies, citizens, practitioners, politicians and scientists, prototyping the open innovation research infrastructure (OI-RI) designed under the leadership of Eveline in a multistakeholder endeavour of an European consortium in 2017. MetaLab is one of the supporting initial partners of this endeavour.

Based on the mission of knowledge4development and against the background of a RRI mission statement, Eveline applies open innovation methods and practices, contributing to the [agenda2030](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld) and the achievement of the [sustainable development goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300) and [good life goals](https://www.goodlifegoals.org/).

Her current projects deal with knowledge science, transformation of genres, digital humanism and future inclusive living; she is experimenting with arts, exponential strategies, open innovation and data company mindset to innovate humanities.

Eveline acts as research manager and initiator on various international boards. She serves as expert in various global initiatives, mainly in the area of technical and social infrastructures, such as [ADHO](https://adho.org/), [ALLEA](https://www.allea.org/working-groups/overview/working-group-e-humanities/), [COST](https://www.cost.eu/) actions, [DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu/), [ECSA](https://ecsa.citizen-science.net/), as well as standarization bodies.
