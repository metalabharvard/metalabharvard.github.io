Exploration space is an open space for innovation and experimentation for the networked humanities with the aim of stimulating, designing, enabling and scientifically analyzing new forms of knowledge production at the interface of science, technology and society. It is a best practice example for open innovation of the [Austrian government](http://openinnovation.gv.at/portfolio/oeaw-exploration-space/).

Her current projects deal with re-inventing the genre of the dictionary and prototyping the post dictionary, knowledge science and digital transformation in the humanities; she is experimenting with arts, exponential strategies, open innovation and data company mindset to innovate humanities.
