Kyle Parry is assistant professor in the History of Art and Visual Culture at the University of California Santa Cruz. He researches across the history and theory of media, contemporary art and cultural memory, and digital and networked culture. His current book project explores shifting conditions and possibilities for mediating and visualizing disasters; related written and practice-based projects investigate the potentials and politics in digital archival and assembly-based responses to ecological violence. Emerging research domains build on these themes, including recent inquiry into histories of photographic hyper-production as well as issues of scaffolding and performativity in digital communication and pedagogy. At metaLAB, Kyle was a principal and doctoral researcher from 2011-15, while completing his PhD in Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard.
