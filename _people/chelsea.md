Chelsea Qiu is a designer and architect in training. Her previous research focuses on a new architectural typology for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in which humans co-inhabit with autonomous machines. Topics of interest include the ethics of citizens as data subjects, the implications of public space commoditization, and the agency of architecture as a medium for empowerment. Chelsea graduated from the School of Architecture and Planning at MIT, where she has developed an interest in visualization and digital fabrication. Prior to graduate school, she has worked as an architectural designer in New York, London, Toronto, and Guangzhou.

As an assistant researcher at metaLAB, Chelsea is currently working with Gallerie Estensi on the design of a multi-sensorial experience of historical musical instruments from the Italian Renaissance.
