Halsey Burgund is a sound artist and technologist whose work focuses on the combination of modern technologies—from mobile phones to artificial intelligence—with fundamentally human “technologies”, primarily language, music, and the spoken voice. He is the creator of Roundware, the open source contributory audio AR platform, which has been used to create art and educational installations for cultural organizations internationally. Halsey was a Smithsonian Artist Research Fellow, a Research Affiliate at the MIT Media Lab, and is currently a fellow at the MIT Open Documentary Lab.
