Architect and Communication Designer Paolo Ciuccarelli is the Director of the [Center for Design](https://camd.northeastern.edu/center-for-design/) and Professor of Design at Northeastern University, a position to which he was named after twenty years at Politecnico di Milano in Italy. At Politecnico, he coordinated the Communication Design program (BSc and MSc), has been member of the board at the PhD in Design and he founded the DensityDesign Research Lab, an award winning laboratory for data visualization and information design. Paolo’s research focuses on the design transformations that help making sense of data and information to improve decision making processes, especially with non experts stakeholders and for controversial complex social issues where he’s also experimenting on the role of rhetorics and visual poetry for a deeper engagement. He also works in developing tools and methods to understanding the evolution of the design discipline in the frame of a meta-design approach. Paolo is the author of award-winning publications, lectured at the Royal College of Arts, ENSCI Les Ateliers, Glasgow School of Arts, king’s College and Stanford Humanities Centre, and has been invited to talk at conferences such as Eyeo, TEDx, Visualized, NetSci, Congreso Futuro.
