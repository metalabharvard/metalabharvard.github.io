Mike Maizels is an art historian and curator  whose work brings the
visual arts into productive collision with a broad range of
disciplinary histories and potential futures.  As an historian, he has
undertaken several book projects including Barry Le Va: The Aesthetic
Aftermath (University of Minnesota, 2015), In and Out Phase: An
Episodic History of Art and Music in the 1960s (Forthcoming,
University of Michigan), and Collecting the Now: Studies in the
Postwar Art Market (In Progress).

Maizels curatorial ventures have included  the first museum
retrospective given to a videogame maker (The Game Worlds of Jason
Rohrer) and lead to the discovery of hidden CIA training camps in the
Arkansas National Forest (Until it Reached Into Our Lives...).  He is
now at work on two major projects,  a multimedia opera produced in
collaboration with two members of 808 Mafia, and a cryptocurrency
mining installation that will be presented in both the US and China
next year.

In addition to his work at metaLAB, Maizels is concurrently pursuing
an MBA at the MIT Sloan Fellows Program (2019-2020)
