As a visual researcher and information designer, Kim Albrecht is interested in networks, power, the artificial, and how we can find visual representations for these topics to produce and represent knowledge. Kim holds a BA in graphic design from the AAA school and an MA in interface design from the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. From 2015 to 2017, Kim worked at the Center for Complex Network Research with Prof. Laszlo Barabasi as a visualization researcher in Boston. His research is focused on the visual representation of complex systems and particularly complex networks.

In 2016, Kim started his Ph.D. research at the University of Potsdam in the field of media theory, researching information visualizations and their interfaces regarding their epistemological value and how they help us to make sense of the world. 
In spring 2017, Kim joined metaLAB (at) Harvard to research the intersection between artificial intelligence and culture as well as finding new representations of cultural collections. In 2020, he became a metaLAB principal, in recognition of his leadership and creative influence.
