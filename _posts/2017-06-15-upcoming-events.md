This is an optional creative workshop open to all in the BKC community to *come think through ideas and challenges related to Artificial Intelligence* and work with creative materials to either raise questions or try to answer them. It will be collaborative, experimental, and fun. Mark your calendars and keep an eye out for more information in the coming weeks.
